The text primarily discusses a failed government scheme related to online university courses, focusing on financial aspects such as the cost of the project, the lack of private sector investment, and the financial mismanagement highlighted by the payment of a bonus to the chief executive despite the project's failure. The involvement of the Commons education select committee and the discussion of business plans and market research further align the text with business-related topics, rather than politics or technology, which might also seem relevant but are not the central focus."

Reasoning: The text primarily discusses the financial and management aspects of selling the Millennium Dome, including the involvement of various government bodies and financial implications for taxpayers. The focus is on the economic management, the cost to maintain and sell the Dome, and the financial benefits of the final deal. Although the Dome's intended use includes sport and entertainment, the text does not delve into these aspects in detail but rather emphasizes the business and economic challenges and outcomes of the sale process. Thus, the major topic aligns with ""business"" rather than the other categories provided."
